## Standard Markdown

### BLOCK ELEMENTS

##### HEADERS

```
This is an H1
=============

This is an H2
-------------

```

Any number of underlining =’s or -’s will work.

```
# This is an H1

## This is an H2

###### This is an H6

```

##### BLOCKQUOTES

```
> This is the first level of quoting.
>
> > This is nested blockquote.
>
> Back to the first level.

```

Blockquotes can contain other Markdown elements, including headers, lists, and code blocks:

```
> ## This is a header.
> 
> 1.   This is the first list item.
> 2.   This is the second list item.
> 
> Here's some example code:
> 
>     return shell_exec("echo $input | $markdown_script");

```

##### LISTS

```
*   Red
*   Green
*   Blue

```

is equivalent to:

```
+   Red
+   Green
+   Blue

```

and:

```
-   Red
-   Green
-   Blue

```

Ordered lists use numbers followed by periods:

```
1.  Bird
2.  McHale
3.  Parish

```

##### CODE BLOCKS

```
This is a normal paragraph:

    This is a code block.

```

One level of indentation — 4 spaces or 1 tab — is removed from each line of the code block. For example, this:

```
Here is an example of AppleScript:

    tell application "Foo"
        beep
    end tell

```

##### HORIZONTAL RULES

```
* * *

***

*****

- - -

---------------------------------------

```

##### HARD LINE BREAKS

End a line with two or more spaces:

```
Roses ar red,  
Violets are blue.

```

### SPAN ELEMENTS

##### LINKS

```
This is [an example](http://example.com/ "Title") inline link.

[This link](http://example.net/) has no title attribute.

```

Here’s an example of reference links in action:

```
I get 10 times more traffic from [Google][] than from
[Yahoo][] or [MSN][].

  [google]: http://google.com/        "Google"
  [yahoo]:  http://search.yahoo.com/  "Yahoo Search"
  [msn]:    http://search.msn.com/    "MSN Search"

```

##### EMPHASIS

```
*single asterisks*

_single underscores_

**double asterisks**

__double underscores__

```

##### CODE

```
Use the `printf()` function.

```

##### IMAGES

```
![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg)

![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg "Optional title")

![Alt text][id]
[id]: /path/to/img.jpg "Optional title"

```

##### EMAIL

```
Contact to <example@example.com>.

```
