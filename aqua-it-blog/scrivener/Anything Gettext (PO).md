## Anything Gettext (PO)

Write translations for any software or web site that uses [Gettext](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettext) for localization. Gettext is used widely, in many programming languages and many projects – from WordPress to many PHP projects, Django or pretty much anything on Linux.

## Simple & Efficient Interface

Poedit is intentionally spartan so that the focus is on the translation you’re working on. Just you and the translation, no distractions.

## Safety Checks

Gettext can be tricky at times. One accidentally added % may break things if you’re unlucky. Not to worry, though, Poedit checks for common problems and warns you.

## Translation Memory

Poedit comes with a builtin translation memory to help you translate faster. It remembers your past translations and uses them to make suggestions for similar texts. Over time, it learns enough to fill in frequently used strings for you.

## For Developers Too

Developers can use Poedit to maintain their translation files (or templates) and keep them fresh. It may be too simple for more complicated projects, but most of the time, that simplicity comes handy.
